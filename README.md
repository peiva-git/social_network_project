# Social network project

University project for the web programming exam at the University of Trieste.
This repository contains both the server and the client-side part of the webapp.
The client-side part was built using [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/),
while the server-side part was built using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
,using the [Express web framework](https://expressjs.com/),
and [Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/).

## Project setup
The webapp can be started simply by running the
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/08_using_compose/) command:
```shell
docker compose -f /path/to/docker-compose.yml up
```
By default, the server is listening on the local port `8080`.
